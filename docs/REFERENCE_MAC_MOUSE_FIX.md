# Reference: Mac Mouse Fix (important before copying anything)

You linked: https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix

Mac Mouse Fix is open source, but it uses a **custom MMF License** (not MIT/Apache).
Key points from the license (paraphrased):
- If you publish work derived from MMF source, you must make it apparent it’s derived from MMF source.
- If you publish a compiled executable that includes code copied/derived from MMF source, you may only publish it under conditions, including:
  - no malware
  - you may not charge money
  - and you must keep MMF’s monetization/licensing/trial/payment systems intact and working as intended
  - unless your work includes substantial improvements/additions such that it should be considered its own separate derivative work

Recommendation for this project:
- Use MMF as a **product inspiration** and for understanding the problem space.
- Implement from scratch using public Apple APIs (CoreGraphics event taps, etc.).
- If you choose to reuse MMF code, consult the MMF License carefully and comply.

(Always verify the latest license text in the repository before reuse.)
